    "learn.title": "MY PATH IN CODE",
    "learn.subtitle1": "I started coding when I was younger, tinkering with Python scripts for Counter Strike. It was more of a hobby than anything else, but it really gave me a taste for programming. Like many developers in France, I trained at the Site du Zéro. I've always been the type to learn by myself, exploring and experimenting in my spare time.",
    "learn.subtitle2": "In 2023, I decided it was time to officially validate my skills. I joined a training course at OpenClassrooms to specialize in web development. It was a big step for me, to finally make my passion my profession. What I love about programming is that you're never limited to a single language or technology. I'm still learning and adapting, always curious to discover new horizons in this field."
